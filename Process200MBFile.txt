how to process 200mb file in minimum time?
------------------------------------------
	To process a 200MB file quickly, the strategy depends on the file type, your system resources, and the nature of the processing (e.g., parsing, transforming, analyzing). 
	
	Here’s how to squeeze out maximum performance:

	General Speed-Up Tips:
	----------------------
		Use Streaming Instead of Loading Entire File:
			Process the file line-by-line or in chunks to avoid memory bottlenecks.
		
		Choose Efficient File Formats:
			Binary formats (e.g., Parquet, Avro) are faster to read than text formats like CSV or JSON.
		
		Parallel Processing:
			Use multi-threading or multiprocessing to divide the workload across CPU cores.
		
		Memory Mapping:
			For large binary files, use mmap to access file content without loading it all into RAM.
		
		Optimize Disk I/O:
			Use SSDs instead of HDDs for faster read/write speeds.

	
	Language-Specific Techniques:
	-----------------------------
		Language		Fast Processing Tools/Methods
		--------		-----------------------------
		Java			BufferedReader, Executor Service
		
		
		
	Bonus Tips:
	-----------
		Avoid unnecessary data conversions (e.g., string to float repeatedly).
		
		
To process a 200MB file efficiently in Java, you’ll want to minimize memory usage and maximize I/O throughput.
Here are the fastest and most memory-friendly techniques:

	Recommended Approaches:
	-----------------------
		Method 						Speed 		Memory Usage 	Best For
		------						-----		------------	---------
		FileChannel + ByteBuffer 	Fastest 	Low 			Binary or text files
		BufferedInputStream 		Fast 		Low 			Chunked reading/writing
		Memory-Mapped Files 		Very Fast 	Medium 			Random access, large files


	Performance Tips:
	-----------------
		Use larger buffers (e.g., 1MB or more) to reduce disk access frequency
		Increase buffer size (e.g., 1MB) when using streams
		Avoid reading entire file into memory (readAllBytes() is fast but memory-heavy)
		Profile your code with tools like VisualVM or JFR to find bottlenecks
		Parallelize if processing logic allows (e.g., using ExecutorService)
		Use SSD storage for faster disk I/O
		If possible, split the file into smaller chunks for parallel processin

	
	Bonus: Memory-Mapped File:
	--------------------------
		MappedByteBuffer buffer = FileChannel.open(path).map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, fileSize);

			- Ideal for random access or search-heavy operations.
			- Avoids copying file content into heap.

	
To process a 200MB "XML file" efficiently in Java, you’ll want to avoid loading the entire file into memory. Instead, use streaming parsers like SAX or StAX, which read the file sequentially and are optimized for large datasets.

To process a 200MB "JSON file" efficiently in Java, you’ll want to avoid loading the entire file into memory. Instead, use streaming techniques. Here are the fastest and most memory-friendly approaches: Jackson Streaming API, Gson Streaming API.
