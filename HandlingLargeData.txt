	1. Use Efficient Data Structures:
	---------------------------------
		Prefer ArrayList or LinkedList depending on access vs. insertion needs.
		Use HashMap or ConcurrentHashMap for fast lookups.
		Consider primitive collections (like those from Eclipse Collections or Trove4j) to avoid boxing overhead.

	2. Stream Processing with Java Streams:
	---------------------------------------
		Java 8+ Streams can process large datasets efficiently, especially with parallel streams:

			List<String> data = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("largefile.txt"));
			long count = data.parallelStream()
							 .filter(line -> line.contains("keyword"))
							 .count();


	3. Use Buffered I/O for File Handling:
	--------------------------------------
		Avoid loading entire files into memory. Use BufferedReader:

			try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("largefile.txt"))) {
				String line;
				while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
					// Process line
				}
			}

		//Processing large files efficiently is an important part of many Java applications. The BufferedReader.lines() method, part of the java.io package, provides a simple and efficient way to "read lines from a file as a stream". 
		
		How It Works:
		-------------
			The lines() method leverages the underlying reader to sequentially read lines of text, converting them into a stream. 
			A stream is a sequence of elements that can be processed using operations like filtering, mapping, or reducing. By combining BufferedReader with the Java Stream API, developers can write concise and efficient code for reading and processing large amounts of text.
			
			public static void main(String[] args) {
				try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"))) {
					Stream<String> lines = reader.lines();
					lines.forEach(System.out::println);
				} catch (IOException e) {
					e.printStackTrace();
				}
			}
				
			//Here, the try-with-resources block automatically closes the BufferedReader.

		Large Files and Memory Management:
		----------------------------------
			The lines() method streams data lazily, but improper processing can lead to memory issues. For instance, collecting all lines into a list using collect(Collectors.toList()) on a very large file can exhaust memory. Always process lines incrementally to avoid such issues.

			Example — Processing Without Collecting
			---------------------------------------
				try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("largefile.txt"))) {
					reader.lines().filter(line -> line.contains("INFO")).forEach(System.out::println);
				} catch (IOException e) {
					e.printStackTrace();
				}

	
	4. Memory Management:
	---------------------
		- Use -Xmx JVM option to increase heap size if needed.
		- Use weak references or caches (e.g., WeakHashMap, SoftReference) to avoid memory leaks.
		- Profile memory usage with tools like VisualVM or JProfiler.

	
	5. Multithreading and Concurrency:
	----------------------------------
		Use Java’s concurrency utilities to parallelize processing:
		
		ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
		for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
			executor.submit(() -> {
				// Process chunk of data
			});
		}
		executor.shutdown();


	6. Use External Libraries for Big Data:
	---------------------------------------
		- Apache Spark (Java API): 		For distributed data processing.
		- Apache Hadoop (MapReduce): 	For batch processing large datasets.
		- Apache Kafka: 				For streaming data pipelines.
	
		Example with Spark in Java:
			SparkConf conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("BigDataApp").setMaster("local");
			JavaSparkContext sc = new JavaSparkContext(conf);

			JavaRDD<String> lines = sc.textFile("largefile.txt");
			long count = lines.filter(line -> line.contains("keyword")).count();

	7. Database or Disk-Based Storage:
	----------------------------------
		If the data is too large for memory:
		- Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and query in chunks.
		- Use memory-mapped files (FileChannel.map) for fast disk access.



Best Java Data Structures for Large Datasets:
---------------------------------------------

	1. ArrayList / LinkedList:
	--------------------------
		Use when: 	You need ordered data and frequent iteration.
		Avoid for: 	Massive datasets with frequent insertions/removals in the middle (use LinkedList instead).
		Tip: 		ArrayList is faster for random access; LinkedList is better for frequent insertions/deletions.

	2. HashMap / ConcurrentHashMap:
	-------------------------------
		Use when: 	You need fast key-value lookups.
		ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe and ideal for concurrent access.
		Tip: 	Use custom hash functions or load factor tuning for large-scale maps.

	3. TreeMap / TreeSet:
	---------------------
		Use when: You need sorted data or range queries.
		Slower than HashMap for basic operations (O(log n) vs. O(1)).

	4. PriorityQueue / Heap:
	------------------------
		Use when: 	You need to repeatedly access the smallest/largest element.
		Tip: 		Use a custom comparator for complex sorting logic.

	5. BitSet:
	----------
		Use when: You need to store large sets of boolean flags efficiently.
		Much more memory-efficient than boolean[].

	6. Deque (ArrayDeque / LinkedList):
	-----------------------------------
		Use when: You need fast insertions/removals from both ends.
		Great for implementing sliding windows or queues.

	7. Custom Data Structures with Arrays:
	--------------------------------------
		Use when: 	You need tight control over memory and performance.
		Tip: 		Use primitive arrays (int[], double[]) to avoid boxing overhead.


	8. Specialized Libraries for Large Datasets:
	--------------------------------------------
		Library 						Highlights
		-------							----------
		Trove4j 						High-performance collections for primitives (e.g., TIntHashMap)
		Eclipse Collections 			Rich set of memory-efficient, fast collections for primitives and objects 
		FastUtil 						Similar to Trove, optimized for large-scale primitive collections
		Apache Commons Collections 		Extended collection utilities and data structures



	9. For Concurrency and Parallelism:
	-----------------------------------
		ConcurrentLinkedQueue, CopyOnWriteArrayList, BlockingQueue – for thread-safe operations.
		ForkJoinPool – for parallel processing of large datasets.

Pro Tips:
---------
	Use memory profiling tools (like VisualVM or JMH) to benchmark and tune.
	Avoid unnecessary object creation—prefer primitives and reuse objects where possible.
	Consider off-heap storage (e.g., using ByteBuffer or memory-mapped files) for ultra-large datasets.
