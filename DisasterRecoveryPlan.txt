Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):
-----------------------------
	A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is a structured strategy that helps organizations bounce back from unexpected disruptions—whether it's a cyberattack, natural disaster, or system failure. It’s like a business’s emergency playbook for restoring operations and minimizing damage.

	Key Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan:
	-------------------------------------------
		Risk Assessment: Identify potential threats (e.g., ransomware, floods, hardware failure) and their impact.
		
		Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Determine which systems and processes are critical and how long they can be down.
		
		Recovery Objectives:
			RTO (Recovery Time Objective): How quickly systems must be restored.
			RPO (Recovery Point Objective): How much data loss is acceptable.
		
		Backup Strategy: Define how and where data is backed up—cloud, offsite, or hybrid.
		
		Failover Systems: Set up alternate infrastructure (hot/warm/cold sites) to take over during outages.
		
		Communication Plan: Outline how to notify employees, customers, and stakeholders.
		
		Roles & Responsibilities: Assign tasks to specific team members during a disaster.
		
		Testing & Maintenance: Regularly simulate disasters to ensure the plan works and stays up to date.

	
	Types of Disaster Recovery Plans:
	---------------------------------
		Type 									Description
		----									-----------
		Virtualized DRP 						Uses virtual machines for rapid recovery
		Network DRP 							Focuses on restoring network connectivity 
		Cloud DRP 								Leverages cloud services for backup and recovery
		Data Center DRP 						Restores physical infrastructure and systems
		DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service) 	Outsources recovery to a third-party provider 


	Benefits:
	---------
		Minimizes downtime and data loss
		Reduces financial and reputational damage
		Ensures compliance with regulations
		Builds trust with customers and stakeholders.
		
		
			
	Key Components of the Plan:
	---------------------------
		Component 				Strategy
		---------				--------
		Backup & Restore 		Use versioned backups for each service’s data store; test restores regularly.
		Failover Mechanisms 	Deploy services across multiple zones/regions; use load balancers and health checks.
		Configuration Sync 		Store configs in version-controlled repositories; use tools like Consul or etcd.
		Traffic Routing 		Use DNS failover, global load balancers, and service mesh for dynamic routing. 
		Session Management 		Externalize session state (e.g., Redis) with cross-region replication.
		Dependency Mapping 		Maintain a map of service dependencies to prevent cascading failures.
		Testing & Simulation 	Run chaos engineering drills and game days to validate recovery procedures.


	Recovery Strategies:
	--------------------
		Active-Active Deployment: 	Run services in multiple regions simultaneously for instant failover.
		Hot Standby: 				Keep backup services running but idle, ready to take over instantly.
		Warm Standby: 				Services are partially synced and can be activated quickly.
		Cold Standby: 				Services are offline but can be spun up manually—slower but cost-effective.


	Tools & Technologies:
	---------------------
		Kubernetes: 			For orchestrating containerized services with built-in self-healing and scaling.
		Istio / Linkerd: 		Service mesh for traffic control, observability, and security.
		Velero: 				Backup and restore for Kubernetes clusters.
		Prometheus + Grafana: 	Monitoring and alerting.
		Terraform / Pulumi: 	Infrastructure as Code for consistent environment setup.
