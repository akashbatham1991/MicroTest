Port Already in Use Spring Boot - Fixed:
----------------------------------------
	In Spring Boot applications, if you see an error indicating that a port is already in use, it means another process (possibly another instance of your application or a different application) is already running and using the desired port.
	
	The default port for a Spring Boot web application is 8080. 

	Resolution:
	-----------
	
	1) 
	Change the Spring Boot Application Port:
	
	by adding or modifying the server.port property: the application.properties or application.yml file:

		if you're using application.properties:	
			server.port=8081

		Or, 
		
		if you're using application.yml:
			server:
			  port: 8081


	
	2)
	Identify the Process Using the Port and Kill the Process
	
	3)
	Ensure You're Not Starting the Application Multiple Times
