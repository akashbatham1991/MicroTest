Diff b/w streaming and batching:
--------------------------------

	Analogy:
	--------
		Batching: 	Like doing laundry once a week, you wait until there’s enough to process.
		Streaming: 	Like washing each item as soon as it gets dirty instant but resource-intensive.


	Batching:
	---------
		Definition: Processes large volumes of data at scheduled intervals.
		Data Flow: 	Data is collected, stored, and processed in chunks.
		Latency: 	Higher latency—results are available after processing completes.
		
		Use Cases:
			Payroll systems
			Monthly reports
			ETL jobs
		
		Pros:
			Efficient for large datasets
			Easier to debug and audit
			Lower infrastructure cost
		
		Cons:
			Delayed insights
			Not suitable for real-time needs


	Streaming:
	----------
		Definition: Processes data in real time as it arrives.
		Data Flow: 	Continuous flow—each event is processed immediately.
		Latency: 	Low latency—results are available within milliseconds or seconds.
		
		Use Cases:
			Fraud detection
			IoT sensor data
			Live dashboards
		
		Pros:
			Real-time insights
			Ideal for time-sensitive decisions
			Scales with data velocity
		
		Cons:
			More complex to implement
			Higher infrastructure demands


What are the implementation ways of batching and streaming ?
------------------------------------------------------------
	To implement batching and streaming, you’ll need to choose the right tools, architectures, and strategies based on your data needs. Here’s a practical breakdown of how each is typically implemented:

	Batching Implementation:
	------------------------
		Batch processing handles large volumes of data at scheduled intervals. It’s ideal for tasks like reporting, ETL jobs, and data warehousing.
	
		Tools & Frameworks:
		--------------------
			Apache Spark: 		Distributed processing for large-scale batch jobs.
			Hadoop MapReduce: 	Classic batch processing for big data.
			Apache Airflow: 	Workflow orchestration for scheduled jobs.
			AWS Glue / Azure Data Factory: Cloud-native ETL pipelines.
		
		Architecture:
		-------------
			Data is collected and stored (e.g., in S3, HDFS, or a database).
			Jobs are triggered on a schedule (e.g., nightly or hourly).
			Processing happens in bulk, often using parallel computation.

		Use Cases:
		----------
			Monthly billing reports
			Historical data analysis
			Data migration


	Streaming Implementation:
	-------------------------
		Streaming processes data in real time as it arrives. It’s perfect for time-sensitive applications like fraud detection or live analytics.
	
		Tools & Frameworks:
		-------------------
			Apache Kafka: Message broker for real-time data ingestion.
			Apache Flink / Spark Streaming: Real-time data processing engines.
			Amazon Kinesis / Azure Event Hubs: Cloud-native streaming platforms.
			Apache NiFi: Visual flow-based stream processor.
		
		Architecture:
		-------------
			Producers send data to a stream (e.g., Kafka topic).
			Consumers process data continuously using stream processors.
			State management and windowing handle time-based aggregations.

		Use Cases:
		----------
			Real-time dashboards
			IoT sensor data
			Social media monitoring
			Stock market feeds


Can we use spring batch library for batch processing in place of Apache Spark ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Yes, you can use Spring Batch instead of Apache Spark for batch processing—but it depends heavily on your use case. Here's a breakdown to help you decide:
	
	When Spring Batch Is a Good Fit:
	--------------------------------
		Enterprise workloads: Ideal for traditional batch jobs like payroll, billing, or data migration.		
		Example: Processing 2 million rows from a database and exporting to JSON—Spring Batch handles this well.


	When Apache Spark Is Better:
	----------------------------
		Big data workloads: Designed for distributed processing across clusters.		
		Example: Aggregating logs from millions of IoT devices in real time—Spark is built for this.

	
	Can They Work Together?:
	------------------------
		Yes, You can use Spring Batch to orchestrate Spark jobs:
			Spring Batch handles job scheduling, retries, and monitoring.
			Spark performs the heavy lifting for data transformation and analytics.

	Summary:
	--------
		Criteria 			Spring Batch 				Apache Spark
		--------			------------				------------
		Data Volume 		Moderate 					Massive
		Architecture 		Single JVM 					Distributed Cluster
		Use Case 			ETL, reporting, migration 	Big data, ML, stream processing
		Learning Curve 		Easier for Spring devs 		Steeper, requires ecosystem knowledge
		Real-Time Support 	No 							Yes


	If you're working within the Spring ecosystem and don’t need distributed computing, Spring Batch is a great choice. But if you're dealing with big data or real-time analytics, Spark is the better tool.
