	french company, leader in distributor of electrical product supplies in euro, little bit in asia, mainly in canada, dealor for lot of retailier. like philips. 
	
	own digital platform, b2b, e-commerece platform, developed by CG.
	
	across in 18 contries, could be 18 websites. where retails can come and buy from these of brnacs.
	
	give me 5k rockwell electrical equipments.
	
	the tack is, SAP commere server, hybris, java, spring, or complete java stack.
	
	SAP commere server (outdated) need to upgrade it to build new platform from scratch.
	
	backedn as spring boot microservicews.
	fronedn as angular.
	
	complete platform is Azure cloud, Aks k8s, CG also provide DevOps support.
	
	looking to build AI tool,  Gen AI, 
	
	backend systems are erp system, 
	 integration b/w tipco implemetion 
	 
	 tipco and erp are not changes
	 
	 e-commerece db is trancastional data, hold data for temperory period.
	 
	 there are two other ways to sell electrical equipments:
		edi system,
		physical branchs
	 
	 erp as a master db.
	 
	 empliance, content mgmt system.
	 solar search engine,
	 tipco, enterpirse cg layer
	 
	 beyond,we don't have any scope.
	 
	 
	 UI -> tipco -> backend

	how to reengineer and try to build new application ?
	
	how to managing microservicews in cloud?
	
	how to monitor and see performance
	
	10 to 16% is already written in microservicews desing patterns.
